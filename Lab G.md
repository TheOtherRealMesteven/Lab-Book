### Using Parasoft C/C++ Test

**To run Parasoft when not in a CS Lab you'll need to connect to the University VPN (see [Canvas - CS General](https://canvas.hull.ac.uk/courses/17835/pages/setting-up-your-pc)) so that Parasoft is able to contact its license server.**

<details> <!-- Question 2 -->
  <summary> Q2. Testing with Parasoft </summary>

### Errors to fix
![image](https://github.com/TheOtherRealMesteven/Lab-Book/assets/115008465/8d2d9a5b-c555-46a5-af2d-eda5d3ed0981)

<details>
  <summary> Severity 1 </summary>

We are going to fix the first Severity 1 rule violation in `Utility.h` that Parasoft displays `A class 'Utility' must declare a copy assignment operator`

1. Go to the line of code (line 6 of `Utility.h`); this can be done by double-clicking on the violation.
2. Change this line appropriately.
3. Re-run Parasoft on the whole project, and you should see that there are now 10 violations, as we have now fixed the one on line 6.

### Before
```c++
#pragma once
class Utility
{
public:
	Utility(void);
	~Utility(void);
	void SetSize(const int size);
	void Process() const;
	int Mult(int a, int b) const;

private:
	int *m_numberArray;
	int m_size;
};
```

### After
```c++
#pragma once
class Utility
{
public:
	Utility(void);
	~Utility(void) = delete;
	void SetSize(const int size);
	void Process() const;
	int Mult(int a, int b) const;

private:
	int *m_numberArray;
	int m_size;
};
```
