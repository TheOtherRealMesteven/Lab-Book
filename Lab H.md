<details> <!-- Question 1 -->
  <summary> Q1. PersonNode </summary>

## Question:
We are going to implement an Address Book as a Single Linked List (SLL).

The `PersonNode` class will be instantiated to create nodes for our SLL that will hold the name `m_name` and age `m_age` of each person, and will also hold a pointer to the next `m_next` `PersonNode` in the SLL.

This class already has a constructor that can set a name and age.

Add member methods to `PersonNode` so that the name and age can be changed and returned (setters and getters).

We will be required to set and return the `m_next` pointer to the `AddressBookSLL` class so that we can navigate through the SLL. The `m_next` data member pointer is private, which means that if we add the functionality for `PersonNode` class to return this pointer then it should be returned as a `const` pointer. This will unfortunately mean that we cannot navigate through the SLL very easily. Therefore, on this occasion the use of the keyword `friend` is applicable, especially as these two classes are clearly coupled together and cannot be used without each other. Therefore, inside of the `PersonNode.h` file make the `AddressBookSLL` class a friend of the `PersonNode` class, so that `AddressBookSLL` can access the private data members of `PersonNode`.

### PersonNode.h
```c++
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class PersonNode
{
	friend class AddressBookSLL; // Allows AddressBookSLL to access private members
public:
	PersonNode(void);
	PersonNode(const string& name, int age);
	~PersonNode(void);

	// Member setters
	void setName(const string& name) { m_name = name; }
	void setAge(int age) { m_age = age; }

	// Member getters
	string getName() const { return m_name; }
	int getAge() const { return m_age; }

private:
	string m_name;
	int m_age;
	PersonNode* m_next;

	// Member setters
	void setNext(PersonNode* next) { m_next = next; }

	// Member getters
	const PersonNode* getNext() const { return m_next; }
};
```

  <summary> Changes </summary>

### PersonNode.h
```diff
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class PersonNode
{
+	friend class AddressBookSLL; // Allows AddressBookSLL to access private members
public:
	PersonNode(void);
	PersonNode(const string& name, int age);
	~PersonNode(void);

+	// Member setters
+	void setName(const string& name) { m_name = name; }
+	void setAge(int age) { m_age = age; }
+
+	// Member getters
+	string getName() const { return m_name; }
+	int getAge() const { return m_age; }

private:
	string m_name;
	int m_age;
	PersonNode* m_next;

+	// Member setters
+	void setNext(PersonNode* next) { m_next = next; }
+
+	// Member getters
+	const PersonNode* getNext() const { return m_next; }
};
```
#### Description
The changes to the code above create getters and setters for all the private member variables of the class. Whilst keeping the `m_next` field privatised.
Furthermore, the ``friend class`` allows that class to reference the private members as if referencing them from within the current class.

<details> <!-- Question 2 -->
  <summary> Q2. AddressBookSLL </summary>

## Question:
The `AddressBookSLL` class is required to have the functionality to allow for manipulation of the `PersonNodes` that are contained within the SLL.  The `AddressBookSLL` class has a head `PersonNode` called `m_head`.  This will point to the first `PersonNode` in the list.

We require the functionality to add a new personâ€™s details into  `AddressBookSLL`.  Therefore implement the functionality of a public member method using the following method prototype:

```c++
void AddPerson(const string& name, int age);
``` 

This `AddPerson()` method should add a new `PersonNode` to the SLL according to the following pseudo code (it is suggested that you draw a diagram of what is happening before you start to implement this code):

1. If the `m_head` pointer is `nullptr` (i.e. the SLL is empty) then assign a new `PersonNode` to the `m_head` pointer using the provided name and age.
2. Otherwise, if the `m_head` pointer is not `nullptr` and the `m_head` pointer has a `m_next` pointer that is `nullptr` (i.e. there is only one element in the SLL) then assign the new `PersonNode` to this `m_next` pointer.
3. Otherwise, navigate through each linked `PersonNode` in the SLL until we find a `PersonNode` that has a `m_next` pointer that is `nullptr`, then assign the new `PersonNode` to this `m_next`. 

To test your code, add the following code to your `main()` method:
```c++
	book.AddPerson("Darren", 21);
	book.AddPerson("Dawn", 42);
	book.AddPerson("Steven", 18);
	book.AddPerson("Sue", 27);
```

We are instantiating a new `PersonNode` on the heap therefore we are required to take care of our own memory management.  Therefore add the following functionality in the AddressBookSLLâ€™s destructor that will delete any memory that has been created in the `AddressBookSLL` and linked `PersonNode`.

```c++
AddressBookSLL::~AddressBookSLL(void)
{
   while (m_head->m_next != nullptr)
   {
      PersonNode* previous = m_head;
      PersonNode* current = m_head;
      while (current->m_next != nullptr)
      {
         previous = current;
         current = current->m_next;
      }
      delete current;
      previous->m_next = nullptr;
   }
   delete m_head;
   m_head = nullptr;
}
```

```
#### Description
The coding task I had to do was implement the functionality of a public member method using the following method prototype:
```c++
void AddPerson(const string& name, int age);
```
So the header file includes the method description whilst the source file contains the code which iterates through a valid list and adds the new person to the end of the list.

<details> <!-- Question 3 -->
  <summary> Q3. Find, Delete, Output </summary>

## Question:
Add the following functionality to the `AddressBookSLL` class:

1. The ability to find a person from the SLL by using their name:

```c++
const PersonNode* FindPerson(const string& name) const;
```

This method should return the `PersonNode` if the `PersonNode` is found or return `nullptr` if it is not found.

<details>
	<summary> FindPerson </summary>


```c++
const PersonNode* AddressBookSLL::FindPerson(const std::string& name) const
{
    const PersonNode* current = m_head;
    while (current != nullptr)
    {
        if (current -> getName() == name) { return current; }
        current = current -> getNext();
    }
    return nullptr;
}
```
</details>

2. The ability to delete a person from the SLL by using their name:

```c++
bool DeletePerson(const string& name);
```

This method should return `true` if the `PersonNode` was deleted or return `false` if it is not deleted (i.e. not found).

<details>
	<summary> DeletePerson </summary>


```c++
bool AddressBookSLL::DeletePerson(const std::string& name)
{
    PersonNode* current = m_head;
    PersonNode* prev = nullptr;

    while (current != nullptr)
    {
        if (current -> getName() == name)
        { // Delete the node
            if (prev != nullptr) { prev -> setNext(const_cast<PersonNode*>(current -> getNext())); }
            else { m_head = const_cast<PersonNode*>(current -> getNext()); }
            delete current;
            return true;
        }
        prev = current;
        current = const_cast<PersonNode*>(current -> getNext());
    }
    return false;
}
```
</details>

3. The ability to output all of the peopleâ€™s names and ages that our in the AddressBookSLL to an `ostream`.

<details>
	<summary> OutputAllPeople </summary>

```c++
void AddressBookSLL::OutputAllPeople(std::ostream& outputStream) const
{
    const PersonNode* current = m_head;
    while (current != nullptr)
    {
        outputStream << "Name: " << current -> getName() << ", Age: " << current -> getAge() << std::endl;
        current = current -> getNext();
    }
}
```
</details>

To implement the above methods, the following changes are made:
### AddressBookSLL.h
```diff

#include "PersonNode.h"
+#include <iostream>

class AddressBookSLL
{
public:
	AddressBookSLL(void);
	~AddressBookSLL(void);

	void AddPerson(const string& name, int age);
+       const PersonNode* FindPerson(const std::string& name) const;
+       bool DeletePerson(const std::string& name);
+       void OutputAllPeople(std::ostream& os) const;

private:
	PersonNode* m_head;
};
```
