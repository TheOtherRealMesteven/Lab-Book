<details> <!-- Question 1 -->
  <summary> Q1. Passing Command Arguments</summary>

## Question:
Passing Command Arguments

**[LAB BOOK - Record the steps required to enter arguments into Visual Studio]**

## Solution:
### Step 1 - Project properties
![image](https://github.com/TheOtherRealMesteven/Lab-Book/assets/115008465/bedfeff8-8ecf-4a94-a429-75753a20a99e)

Defining visual studios input for executing the project is done via the projects properties.

### Step 2 - Debugging

Under `Configuration Properties` select `Debugging`

### Step 3 - Command Arguments

Under the `Command Arguments` row, you can supply command arguments seperated by spaces.

## Test data:
Project: File Input Output

Arguments: `input.txt` `output.txt`

## Sample output:

As you can see the program did not error nor output the Usage prompt. Therefore, there were three total inputs passed through as expected.

## Reflection:
- If you want to pass in a command argument with a space in the name, do you use speech marks to indicate the selection similar to command prompt?

> [!NOTE]
> `argv[0]` (The first parameter) contains the filepath to the executable running the code.



<details> <!-- Question 2 -->
  <summary> Q2. Copying a Text File </summary>

## Question:
Complete the functionality inside of the `Copy(char filenamein[], char filenameout[])` function. You need to add code that will try to open a text file given by the `filenamein` array as the name of the input file. You need to add code to create and output file using the `filenameout` array as the name of the ouput file. Then you can add code that will take each char from the input file and put it in the output file.

Make sure that you check for the input and output files existence before trying to copy.

Test your code thoroughly, e.g. try providing filenames that do not exist.

**[LAB BOOK - Add you code to your lab book and reflect on how you tested your code]**

## Solution:
<details>
  <summary> Copied character by character </summary>

```c++
bool Copy(char filenamein[], char filenameout[])
{
	ifstream fin(filenamein, ios::in);
	if (fin.is_open()) {
		ofstream fout(filenameout, ios::out);
		if (fout.is_open()) {
			char c;
			while (fin.get(c)) fout << c; 
			fin.close();
			fout.close();
			return true;
		}
		cout << "Error creating the output file " << filenameout << endl;
		fin.close();
		return false;
	}
	cout << "Input file " << filenamein << " does not exist" << endl;
	return false;
}
```

My first attempt at C++ file copying.
- The characters are copied across individually.

</details>
<details>
  <summary> Copied via array </summary>

```c++
bool Copy(char filenamein[], char filenameout[])
{
	ifstream fin(filenamein, ios::in);
	if (fin.is_open()) {
		ofstream fout(filenameout, ios::out);
		if (fout.is_open()) {
			const int arraySize = 4096;
			char c[arraySize];
			while (true)
			{
				fin.read(c, arraySize);
				streamsize size = fin.gcount();
				if (size <= 0) break;
				fout.write(c, size);
			}
			fin.close();
			fout.close();
			return true;
		}
		cout << "Error creating the output file " << filenameout << endl;
		fin.close();
		return false;
	}
	cout << "Input file " << filenamein << " does not exist" << endl;
	return false;
}
```

My second attempt at C++ file copying.
- The characters are copied across using an array allowing strings of characters to be copied across.
- If I used `fin.read` as the while loops condition like the last solution, no characters would be copied.
- `fout.write` wouldnt allow me to use an `int` for the size so I had to use `streamsize` which worked.

The created code performs as it should with the initial sample data. And is programmed to withstand multiple scenarios which could occur when duplicating a text file.
However, when it attempts to copy `different file types` the code fails. I believe that is due to the way the files are opened, `ios:in` and `ios:out` are not as versatile as they are needed to be.

Therefore, the code needs to use something universal to copy the data of different file types. For example: Binary, which is the computer holds data universally.

## Final Solution:
```c++
bool Copy(char filenamein[], char filenameout[])
{
	ifstream fin(filenamein, ios::binary);
	if (fin.is_open()) {
		ofstream fout(filenameout, ios::binary);
		if (fout.is_open()) {
			const int arraySize = 4096;
			char c[arraySize];
			while (true)
			{
				fin.read(c, arraySize);
				streamsize size = fin.gcount();
				if (size <= 0) break;
				fout.write(c, size);
			}
			fin.close();
			fout.close();
			return true;
		}
		cout << "Error creating the output file " << filenameout << endl;
		fin.close();
		return false;
	}
	cout << "Input file " << filenamein << " does not exist" << endl;
	return false;
}
```

## Reflection:
- With `ios::in` and `ios::out` what breakdown does it get of the file and so what data types can be copied?

</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For file copying you need the following namespaces `std` and libraries `iostream` and `fstream`.
